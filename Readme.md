## üß¨ Project Overview

GEO-Uploader simplifies the process of uploading bulk RNA and single-cell genomic datasets to the [NCBI GEO repository](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The application automates metadata sheet generation, handles file uploads via FTP, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing the entire submission workflow.

**Key Benefits:**
- Automated metadata.xlsx generation with MD5 checksums and file information
- Multiple data input methods (Sushi integration, folder selection, direct paths)
- Background job processing with monitoring capabilities
- User role management and administrative oversight

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Conda/Mamba package manager

### Installation

#### Using Makefile (suggested for Mac/Linux)
```bash
# File structure recommended
# GeoUploader/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ geo-uploader/          # This repository
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ geo_uploader_data/     # Auto-created
mkdir GeoUploader && cd GeoUploader
git clone https://github.com/fgcz/geo-uploader.git
cd geo-uploader

# Install environment and dependencies
make setup-env

# Setup configuration files
make setup-config
```

### Update of the following configuration files
- `MAIL_USERNAME` (.env)
- `MAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (.env)
- `BASE_FOLDER_SELECTION` (.flaskenv)

```bash
nano .env 
nano .flaskenv 
# vim, notepad are other good options

# Initialize database
make setup-db
# Available logins are given by default
# (Admin, password)
# (User1, password)
# (User2, password)

# Start development server
conda activate gi_geo-uploader
flask status
flask start-prod
# Click on the links given from the terminal to access the server
# http://127.0.0.1:8000


# If you want to have your application run on the background
# flask start-prod-background
```
### Setup without Makefile (Suggested for Windows)
```bash
# File structure recommended
# GeoUploader/
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ geo-uploader/          # This repository
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ geo_uploader_data/     # Auto-created

mkdir GeoUploader && cd GeoUploader
git clone https://github.com/fgcz/geo-uploader.git
cd geo-uploader

# Create the conda environment from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml || echo "Environment might already exist"
conda activate gi_geo-uploader
# Install the project in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Setup configuration files
# Copy default configuration file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Update of the following configuration files
- `MAIL_USERNAME` (.env)
- `MAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (.env)
- `BASE_FOLDER_SELECTION` (.flaskenv)
 
```bash
# Edit required email configuration
# quit nano with Ctrl+X
nano .env  # Set MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_APP_PASSWORD
nano .flaskenv # SET BASE_FOLDER_SELECTION
# vim, notepad are other options

# Initialize database
flask init-db
# Available logins are given by default
# (Admin, password)
# (User1, password)
# (User2, password)

# Start development server
flask run -p 8000
# Click on the links given from the terminal to access the server
# http://127.0.0.1:8000

```

### Before First Use - Understanding the Software
- Complete GEO registration following the [GEO Upload Guide](https://github.com/fgcz/geo-uploader/blob/main/documentation/GEO_instructions.md).

- For the best experience creating a new session, gather all the files into one folder, and files corresponding to the same sample should have the same prefix. It is only possible to upload files directly under the selected folder, so no multi-folder file selection is possible.

- There are 3 different accounts to be set up for this tool, do not confuse them.
  - GEO repository personal folder + password
  - GEO Uploader account login - only serves for distinguishing users
  - (Optional) MAIL configuration - for being able to register new users and receiving email notifications


### Example Upload
Once the server is up and running, and you can access it, you can try a mock upload.  
`/gstore/projects/raw_processed_paired` contains some data which is ready for testing.

## Trouble Shooting
- flask not recognized as a command
  - Make sure that the conda environment gi_geo-uploader is active, some terminals fail silently to activate it

- job failures
  - There can be many reasons, one common one is that the port on which the server is running is not the same as the port the jobs call
  - Make sure that running flask run -p 8000, this port is the same as the port specified in .flaskenv
  - For more debugging power, check the following paths
    - `geo_uploader_data/jobs/jobs.json`
    - `geo_uploader_data/uploads/UPLOAD_TITLE/jobs/upload_md5.out`


- Verification email not sent on new user registration
  - MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_APP_PASSWORD are not set correctly in .env

- Google Account doesn't support AppPasswords
  - Google doesn't support app passwords when the two factor authentication is not activated
  - Either turn on the two factor authentication, or skip the notifications
  - When skipping the notifications, new accounts cannot be registered, on of the default accounts has to be used for uploads.

- Cannot find the folder you are looking for on a new submission
  - Update your BASE_PATH in .flaskenv, everything is shown relative to this
  - No need to re-install, just Ctrl+C and restart the server again
  - If the path is correct, and you still can't see the folder, I suspect it has to do with the number of folders in the root.
  - In the code there is the line `max_items = 200`, if the folder has more than 100 items, it will not show the other files/directories
    - You are free to change this line in the `directory_service.py` file
- Cannot install using Makefile
  - Use the alternative version without Makefile for Windows (documented above)

- `lsof` error on Windows when running `flask start-prod` or `flask status`
  - lsof is a command only for Mac/Linux, in a Windows computer use the alternative commands to start the server
  - `flask run`

- Metadata.xlsx sheet template is deprecated, not accepted by GEO anymore.
  - Because we save a local copy of the Metadata.xlsx, whenever GEO updates their expectations, a by hand update of the file also is needed.
  - You need to update the `/geo-uploader/geo_uploader/utils/metadata_seq_template.xlsx` file with the new version
  - Also the code needs to be changed to reflect the new structure, whenever this happens, I suggest pulling the latest repository commit
  - We will keep the most recent metadata version up to date here so you don't have to.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### System Components
- **Flask Monolith**: MVC architecture with service layer
- **Database**: SQLite with Alembic migrations
- **Job Processing**: Slurm scheduler with fallback to background processes
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login with LDAP integration (FGCZ)
- **Admin Interface**: Flask-Admin for user management and oversight
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with configurable upload directories

### External Services
| Service | Purpose | Scope |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Sushi Database | Dataset integration | FGCZ only |
| LDAP | User authentication | FGCZ only |
| FTP | File uploads to GEO | All users |
| Slurm | Job scheduling | Server-dependent |
| Email Service | Notifications | All users |


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Files
- **`.env`**: Sensitive configuration (database, API keys, passwords)
- **`.flaskenv`**: Flask-specific settings (debug mode, ports)
- **`config.py`**: Application configuration classes

### Configuration Classes (config.py)
- BaseConfig
- Development
- Production
